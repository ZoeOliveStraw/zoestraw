                <h3>I've been obsessed with games ever since I was a kid. I thought that
                  video games were these magical, impossible worlds that lived in my TV
                  and I loved exploring them. As a young child I filled countless graph
                  paper notebooks with dungeon layouts, character drawings, descriptions
                  of systems that I wanted to make. I spent all of my free time imagining
                  the kinds of games that I might make if I were able to.
                  <br/><br/> As I got older, some of the magic inherent to games gave way to a
                  deeper, more mechanistic understanding of the underlying systems. Genres
                  and trends filled out my understanding of a medium and, while I would
                  always love games, I definitely never felt like I did as a child for
                  a long time.
                  <br/><br/>VR made me feel like a kid again, and ignited an immense
                  passion.
                  <br/><br/>I'll admit, before using one I
                  thought that VR was another gimmick that would come and go. This was in
                  2017 when the original Vive had just come out. A friend had one and offered
                  to let me try it. I popped on the headset and played a dungeon crawler,
                  Vanishing Realms. I was immediately transported. It was incredible! Using my
                  arms to notch the bow and arrows, the sheer degree of immersion provided
                  by the HMD, the intuitive way you interacted with the world... It was incredible.
                  I knew that this was what I wanted to work in, but I had no relevant skills.
                  <br/><br/>It took me some time before I was able to take a long enough break
                  to go to school. I had been working for many years at that point, totally not
                  realizing my potential... But not I had dreams to aim for. I went to school for
                  computer programmer and in my free time I spent every available second teaching
                  myself game engines and skills that would let me create VR experiences. From simple
                  2D games up to VR games launched into headsets, I was able to get a job at my
                  studio, Durham Mixed Reality Capture. While still studying, I was able to work
                  with some amazing mentors and get experience in VR. I am so happy that I was able
                  to have this opportunity while in school.
